# My Poetry Package

This repository demonstrates how to create and build a Python package using **Poetry**. It covers the installation process, package setup, dependencies, and building the package.

## Poetry Installation

Poetry is a modern tool for Python dependency management and packaging. To install Poetry, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to install Poetry:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

3. After installation, verify Poetry was installed successfully:

    ```bash
    poetry --version
    ```

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. **Create a New Directory for the Package**

```bash
mkdir my_poetry_package
cd my_poetry_package
```
##  Initialize the Package with Poetry  

poetry init --no-interaction

### Install Dependencies  
poetry add requests  

### Building the Package  
poetry build  

### Installing the Package Locally  
poetry install

## setup.py vs poetry:  
Dependency Management  
Setuptools:  
Relies on requirements.txt or manual dependency management.  
Does not inherently support locking dependencies, making dependency resolution less robust.  
Poetry:  
Provides integrated dependency management and resolution.  
Uses poetry.lock to lock exact dependency versions, ensuring reproducible builds.  
Building the Package:  
Setuptools:  
Run the following to build the package:
```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```  
The distribution files are generated in the dist/ directory.
Poetry:  
Run the following to build the package:  
```
poetry build
```
This also generates distribution files in the dist/ directory.

Publishing:  
Publishing to PyPI often requires tools like twine:  
```
twine upload dist/*
```  

Poetry:  
Built-in support for publishing:  
```
poetry publish --build
```  

Virtual Environment Management:  
Setuptools:  
Does not include built-in support for managing virtual environments.  
rely on external tools like virtualenv or venv.  

Poetry:
Automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your project:  
```
poetry install  
poetry shell  
```

## Dependency Management in Setuptools vs Poetry:  
Defining Dependencies:  

With setuptools, dependencies are typically defined in the install_requires parameter of setup.py.  
Alternatively, a requirements.txt file is used to list dependencies separately.  
```
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="mypackage",
    version="0.1.0",
    description="A simple Python package",
    install_requires=[
        "requests>=2.0",  # Minimum version of requests is 2.0
        "numpy",          # Latest version of numpy
    ],
)
```

Example requirements.txt:   
```
requests>=2.0
numpy
pandas>=1.1,<2.0  # Specific version range
```

Installing Dependencies:  
If install_requires is used, dependencies are installed when the package itself is installed:  
pip install .  

If requirements.txt is used:  
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependency Locking:  

Setuptools does not natively support dependency locking (ensuring that specific versions of dependencies are used across environments).
To achieve reproducible builds, you need tools like pip freeze to create a requirements.txt with specific versions:  
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
````

Poetry Dependency Management:  
With Poetry, dependencies are declared in pyproject.toml under [tool.poetry.dependencies].  
```
[tool.poetry]
name = "mypackage"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A simple Python package"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
requests = "^2.0"  # Automatically resolves the latest compatible version
numpy = "*"        # Any version
pandas = ">=1.1,<2.0"
```  
Installing Dependencies:  
```
poetry install  
```
Dependency Locking:  
Poetry automatically generates a poetry.lock file during dependency resolution.
This file locks all dependency versions (including sub-dependencies) to ensure reproducibility.  
```
[[package]]
name = "requests"
version = "2.25.1"
description = "Python HTTP library"
category = "main"
optional = false
python-versions = ">=3.6"

[[package]]
name = "numpy"
version = "1.20.3"
description = "Array processing for numbers"
category = "main"
optional = false
python-versions = ">=3.6"
```
Reproducible Builds:  
To replicate an environment exactly:  
poetry install  

Poetry reads the poetry.lock file and installs the exact versions listed, ensuring the same behavior across systems.

pip freeze:  
1. pip freeze scans the site-packages directory of the current Python environment to identify all installed packages.  
2. It outputs a list of package names and their specific versions in a format that pip install can understand.

Reproducible Environments:  
Save the output of pip freeze to a requirements.txt file to recreate the same environment later:  
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Install these exact versions in another environment:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

Try to update or modify dependencies:  

Suppose you need to update one package (e.g., Flask) to a newer version.  
With pip freeze, you must manually adjust the version in requirements.txt and ensure its new sub-dependencies are compatible with the existing ones.    
Thereâ€™s no automatic resolution or guarantee that the new combination of versions will work without conflicts.  


Key Differences in Updating Dependencies:  
With pip freeze:
Manual Work:

You manually update the version of a package in requirements.txt.  
You must ensure sub-dependencies remain compatible.  
No Resolution:  

pip install -r requirements.txt does not resolve conflicts; it merely installs the specified versions.  
With poetry.lock:  
Automatic Resolution:  
Poetry resolves all dependencies, ensuring compatibility across direct and transitive dependencies.  
Updates poetry.lock with the exact versions after resolution.    

Poetry dependecies resolution:  
Example of a potential conflict:  

Flask@2.1.0 requires Werkzeug>=2.0.  
Your project already has Werkzeug==1.0, which is incompatible.  
Poetry resolves this by:  

Upgrading Werkzeug to a compatible version (e.g., Werkzeug==2.2).  
Ensuring that all dependencies remain functional with the new version.  

When there is no common intersection between the dependency requirements of two packages, Poetry's behavior is to fail gracefully and provide a clear error message. 

With pip install flask==2.1.0:  

pip would upgrade urllib3 to a version satisfying Flask (>=1.26.3), breaking requests silently because requests explicitly requires urllib3==1.26.2.  
No warnings or errors would be provided.  
The project might fail during runtime when requests attempts to use the incompatible urllib3.  

With Poetry:  
Poetry detects the incompatibility at installation time.  
It prevents you from creating a broken environment, ensuring dependency integrity.
